Prepare: Details about the dataset: The data for this analysis will come from FitBit Fitness Tracker Data on Kaggle. These 18 datasets were generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016–05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Individual reports can be parsed by export session ID (column A) or timestamp (column B). Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors / preferences. Limitations of the data: There are a few limitations to the data which include the following:

  1. The sample size is limited (only 33 participants)
  2. User information such as Sex and age is not included. For this analysis the datasets for daily activity, daily calories, daily intensities, daily steps and weight      log information, will be used. R Studio was used to complete this analysis because of the many packages and data visualization features available to explore the        data     with. Installing and Loading packages: For this analysis we have imported “tidyverse”, “here”,” lubridate” and “dplyr” packages. The csv files were            imported into R     Studio and the data frames were created with simple names.
  
Process:

Data cleanup and manipulation

Since the timestamp data is inaccurate, it needs to be divided into date and time components and translated into the proper data and time format.

For increased accuracy, we are using hourly data instead of daily data for calories and intensities. The fact that the same information is present in the daily_activity data should also be taken into account when disregarding the daily_calories and daily_intensities data. In this case study, I identified numerous trends and theorized their causes using Fitbit tracker data. Based on those conclusions, I was then able to create an action-based plan.
